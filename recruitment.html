          <h2>Advantages of Joining</h2>
            <p>
              Our team strives to promote interests and lessons related to STEM and other non-technical areas. Our members develop non-technical skills like public speaking and organization. 
              Students who join and actively participate are able to gain experiences and new skills in different areas, such as in welding, programming, and building. Active members can also 
              gain experience with powertools and CAD (computer-aided design). Members also gain the advantage of our alumni network, made up of people who have gone to schools like UC Berkeley, 
              Brown University, UCLA, Cornell, and others and are working at top companies like Google. 
            </p>
          <h2>Schedule</h2>
            <p>
              In the Fall, we meet every Thursday from 5:30 to 7:30. Our first few meetings around the beginning of the school year will focus on welcoming new students with activities like 
              open houses, demonstrations, and Q&A sessions. In January, build season kicks off, with the team meeting much more frequently to create a robot for competition within a 6 week limit.
              If you think that you might be interested, drop by one of our meetings! We typically meet at the Florence Career Center at 126 E Howe Springs Rd, near South Florence High School. 
              Please contact the team email <a href = "mailto:frcteam1758@gmail.com">here</a> to let us know ahead of time.
