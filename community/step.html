                  <h2>The Event</h2>
                    <p>The Technomancers visited Briggs Elementary School, hosting several interactive activities for Briggs students. Some of the activities included
                      "Bubble and POP," in which students produced and popped bubbles of nitrogen gas with dry ice, producing mystifying fog and colorful bursts, and 
                      "Parachute Drop," which had students compete against each other by constructing parachutes, trying to produce a parachute that would take the longest 
                      to land on the ground from a set point. Each activity was supervised and guided by members of the team, ensuring the safety and enjoyment of the several 
                      students who attended.</p>
