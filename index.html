              Team 1758 The Technomancers is an FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) team comprised of students of the different high schools in Florence, South Carolina. 
              We work to promote interests in areas related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and positive values to the people, schools, companies, and organizations 
              of our community.

            <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 description">
              <p>From our beginning in 2005, FIRST Team 1758 has enjoyed the support provided by Florence School District One (Florence, SC).  
                FSD1 has provided funding, facilities, and teacher support along with students from the three District One high schools: <br/>
                <a href="https://www.fsd1.org/southflorence">South Florence High School</a>,
                <a href="https://www2.fsd1.org/schools/westflorence">West Florence High School</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.fsd1.org/wilson">Wilson High School</a>. <br/>
                Our facilities, tools, and equipment is provided by Principal Al Bradley of the Florence Career Center, with which we enable students
                to develop a wide variety of skills through hands-on participation from all student members. Members of our team have gone on to study 
                at universities like Georgia Tech, Brown, MIT, UC Berkeley, and many others. Learn more about the team <a href = "about/team.html">here.</a>

              <p>
                The Technomancers work with local schools, companies, and organizations, striving to boost interests in STEM-related fields and share key values.
                We've worked with local elementary schools to hold events like <a href = "community/step.html">Step By Stem</a>, with Radioshack for its 
                <a href = "community/radioshack.html">DIY Drone Event</a>, and the Florence Downtown Development Corporation in the annual <a href = "community/pecan.html">Pecan Festival</a>.
                Aside from these activities, we've also worked in charity efforts and plan to be more active in our community in the future.
