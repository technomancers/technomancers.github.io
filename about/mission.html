                  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>As an FRC team, we strive to provide opportunities for students to learn and develop skills in both STEM and in life. Some employees of our sponsors
                      are generous enough to volunteer as mentors for our students, teaching us how to use and interact with incredible software, hardware, and power tools.
                      Even above striving for results, we emphasize the importance of having fun and staying positive when interacting with other teammates and students at competitions and 
                      in general.</p>
                  <h2>Our Goals</h2>
                    <p>The Technomancers encourage hands-on participation from all members, enabling students to gain skills applicable in college and the workplace. 
                      We provide students with exposure to welding, programming, mechanical design, and more to boost their abilities and support their futures. Members of 
                      FRC Team 1758 have gone on to attend universities like Georgia Tech, Brown, Duke, MIT, UPenn, and Clemson, majoring in STEM fields and finding work with
                      incredible companies like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
