            <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>From our beginning in 2005, FIRST Team 1758 has enjoyed the support provided by Florence School District One (Florence, SC).  
                FSD1 has provided funding, facilities, and teacher support along with students from the three District One high schools: <br/>
                <a href="https://www.fsd1.org/southflorence">South Florence High School</a><br/>
                <a href="https://www2.fsd1.org/schools/westflorence">West Florence High School</a><br/>
                <a href="https://www.fsd1.org/wilson">Wilson High School</a><br/>
                Our facilities, tools, and equipment is provided by Principal Al Bradley of the Florence Career Center, with which we enable students
                to develop a wide variety of skills through hands-on participation from all student members. Members of our team have gone on to study 
                at universities like Georgia Tech, Brown, MIT, UC Berkeley, and many others.

              <h2>COMPETITIONS</h2>
              <p>
                We have competed in FRC regionals since 2005, winning the Palmetto Regional in 2008 and reaching the semis in 2010, 2012, and 2014.
                In recent years, we have competed in regional competitions in Richmond, Virginia, West Palm Beach, Florida, and Huntsville, Alabama.
                The team has also participated in the SCRIW off-season event in Columbia, SC for several years.
